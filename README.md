## Customer Analytics

- Understanding the fundamental marketing modeling theory: segmentation, targeting, positioning, marketing mix, and price elasticity

- Apply segmentation techniques to divide your customers into groups based on similarities. Youâ€™ll be starting from raw data and reaching final customer segments

- Perform K-means clustering with a customer analytics focus
 
- Apply Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of your data

- Combine PCA and K-means for even more professional customer segmentation

- Perform exploratory analysis on your data and gain insight into customers shopping habits

- Use elasticity of purchase probability to predict the shopping behavior of the average customer, as well as the customers segments

- Model brand choice by exploring own-price and cross-price elasticity

- Complete the purchase analytics cycle by predicting purchase quantity elasticity

- Carry out a black box deep learning model with TensorFlow 2.0 to predict purchasing behavior with unparalleled accuracy

- Optimize your neural networks to improve results even further
